      <p>WebGS (short for Web Grading System) is the brainchild of Kelsey Young and Isabel Kishi, two computer science section leaders at the University of Arizona. Grading Java programs can be a bit tedious at times, and we thought to ourselves, can we make it better?</p>
      <p>The purpose of WebGS was to supplant and combine the two previously implemented grading systems: command line diff grading and <a href="https://web-cat.cs.vt.edu">WebCat</a>. Using the CodeIgniter PHP framework, over the course of a summer we've built a system to cut down grading time for the section leader and give easy-to-read feedback to our students.</p>
